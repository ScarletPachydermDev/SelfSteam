"""Standalone (non-RetroArch) emulator catalog and launch helpers.

Unlike retroarch_cores.py -- one RetroArch app loading many interchangeable
cores via a single -L flag -- each entry here is its own separate, self-
contained application with its own CLI conventions. There's no shared
launch pattern across them, so each gets its own small args-builder
function rather than a generic one.

Two install_type values, matching the Emulators tab's own Flathub/
AppImage toggle:
  "flathub" -- a real Flatpak app, installed via `flatpak install`.
  "binary"  -- a portable build (AppImage or tarball) resolved fresh from
               the emulator project's own update API/release feed each
               time (same idea as retroarch_cores.py pulling cores from
               libretro's buildbot), not a fixed URL. Not implemented
               yet -- installed()/install() only handle "flathub" so
               far; the field exists now so the tab's dropdown-filtering
               logic has something real to filter on ahead of the first
               binary-type entry being added.
